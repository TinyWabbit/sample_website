    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding.<br> 
        This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        <br><br>
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
        learning technical sophistication, probably more.<br>

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.<br>It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin.<br> 
        We believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
        <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more.

    <p>When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <p>You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy 
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
         at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-
         spec'd lines of code from a
          tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
